# MarkovianF1-ATPase

This is a Python package for realization of a top-down Markov model for F1-ATPase.

F1-ATPase is part of the essential and ubiquitous protein F1FO-ATP synthase, responsible for ATP synthesis in all cells ("energy currency factory").
F1-ATPase itself is a delicate rotary molecular motor, whose mechanism is known as the paradigm of rotary catalysis.

With this package, all kinds of behaviors (e.g. steady state populations, enzyme kinetics, occupancies) can be predicted and compared with experimental data.
Data visualization codes also included.

As a demo: use the jupyter notebook RUNME.ipynb; demo.init.csv is the input file specifying parameters.
